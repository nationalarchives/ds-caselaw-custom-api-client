# Caselaw Marklogic API Client

This is an API Client for connecting to Marklogic for The National Archive's Caselaw site.

This package is published on PyPI: https://pypi.org/project/ds-caselaw-marklogic-api-client/

## Usage

Include the API client in your project using PIP:
```bash
pip install ds-caselaw-marklogic-api-client
```

or in your projects `requirements.txt` with:
```text
ds-caselaw-marklogic-api-client~=2.0.0
```

### Using the client

The client expects the following environment variables to be set or defined in a `.env` file:

```bash
MARKLOGIC_HOST
MARKLOGIC_USER
MARKLOGIC_PASSWORD
MARKLOGIC_USE_HTTPS # Optional, defaults to False
```

Then import `api_client` from `caselawclient.Client`:

```python
from caselawclient.Client import api_client
```

Alternatively, you can import the base class and instantiate it with different credentials:

```python
from caselawclient.Client import MarklogicApiClient

client = MarklogicApiClient(
    host="",
    username="",
    password="",
    use_https=False,
)
```

`Client` also exports some exception classes:
```python
MarklogicAPIError
MarklogicBadRequestError
MarklogicUnauthorizedError
MarklogicNotPermittedError
MarklogicResourceNotFoundError
MarklogicCommunicationError
```

### XML Tools
There is also a small set of xml helper tools that provide some common functionality for dealing with xml:

```python
from caselawclient import xml_tools

xml_tools.get_metadata_name_value(xml)
xml_tools.get_metadata_name_element(xml)
xml_tools.get_search_matches(element)
```

## Testing

To run the test suite:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
python -m pytest
```

The package will **only** be released to PyPI if the branch is tagged. A merge
to main alone will **not** trigger a release to PyPI.

To create a release:

0. Update the version number in `setup.cfg`
1. Create a branch `release/v{major}.{minor}.{patch}`
2. Update changelog for the release
3. Commit and push
4. Open a PR from that branch to main
5. Get approval on the PR
6. Tag the HEAD of the PR `v{major}.{minor}.{patch}` and push the tag
7. Merge the PR to main and push
